\label{chap:Recovery}
The recovery methods are implemented after the detection of an anomaly and the classification thereof. Three different methods of recovery are proposed and compared. These methods are all focused on ensuring that the anomaly does not change the reliability and stability of the EKF.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The \emph{EKF-ignore} method uses the detected sensor that has failed and ignores the sensor measurement from the EKF measurement update. This method is based on the assumption that the EKF estimation is correct up until the moment when the sensor failure is detected. This, however, will highly depend on the accuracy of the anomaly detection method. A detection method with low accuracy will create instability of the EKF since many anomalous measurements will be included in the measurement update of the EKF.
	
	\item The \emph{EKF-reset} method uses a buffer of $\mathbf{v}_{\mathcal{B}_k}$, $\mathbf{v}_{\mathcal{O}_k}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_k^+$ and other parameters that are used to update the EKF. If a sensor failure is detected, the sensor is excluded from the EKF, and the EKF is updated with the sensor data in the buffer, excluding the sensor that has failed. The EKF is, therefore, \emph{reset} and updated from timestep $t_{k-N}$ to $t_k$, where $N$ is the size of the number of timesteps in the buffer. $N$, however, must be optimized based on the computational time used to reset the EKF but still ensure convergence of the EKF. If the sensor that was detected to have anomalous behavior changes back to normal again, the EKF will be reset once again, and the sensor will only be included in the measurement update of $t_k$ since it was anomalous for timesteps before $t_k$.
	
	\item A backtracking method can be combined with the ignore method, \emph{EKF-combination}. For example, where the backtracking method is implemented only after a specified number of anomalies are predicted.
	
%	\item Another method implemented and tested continually uses the two sensors' measurements, \emph{EKF-top2}, that have the smallest mean squared error between the estimated SBC vector and the actual measured SBC vector. There are, however, setbacks to this method. Firstly, it requires the modeling of the ORC vector and requires the position of the satellite in orbit. Secondly, this method will not work with small drifts in a sensor measurement since the estimator will latch unto the drift in the sensor. The method will only detect sudden changes in the sensor and isolate the sudden change even if it remains stable after the sudden change. This method will only be compared to the other methods as part of the analysis since the method is inherently different. The method is also used to aid the other methods during a period after an anomaly is detected.
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis}
To determine the best recovery method that will be implemented a comparison is done on the estimation metric of each recovery method with a $100\%$ prediction accuracy for both the detection and isolation. This is done to determine what the theoretical best outcome is for each of the recovery methods. To determine whether the recovery method provides a robust EKF, the results are given as a average of the estimation metric for each orbit for a duration of $30$ orbits.

\subsection{Sun Reflection}
 In Figure~\ref{fig:RecoveryComparisonReflection} it is clear that the EKF-ignore method outperforms both the EKF-combination and EKF-reset. The estimation metric without any recovery is also given as "None" and it is clear that the EKF performs better without any recovery than with the EKF-reset method. The EKF-ignore method reduces the estimation metric a similar result of the EKF without any anomaly occurring.

\subsection{Magnetic Moment Disturbance}
It is evident in Figure~\ref{fig:RecoveryComparisonMagnetic} that only ignore the magnetometer during the measurement update of the EKF does enhance the estimation performance. This is due to the order of the measurement update where the magnetometer is the first sensor in the measurement update and the sun sensor is last. The sun sensor will therefore have a more prominent impact on the EKF than the magnetometer.

\section{Summary}
From both Figure~\ref{fig:RecoveryComparisonReflection} and Figure~\ref{fig:RecoveryComparisonMagnetic} it is clear that the EKF-ignore method out performs the other recovery methods. This is implemented by only excluding the sensor measurement with an anomaly from the EKF measurement update.
