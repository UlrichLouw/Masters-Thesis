\section{Binary Feature Extraction}
The classes hyperparameter will be set to 2. The only problem with this, is a very evident 2 classes is eclipse and non-eclipse. Consequently each feature extraction model will be trained twice. Once for the eclipse and once for the non-eclipse period. The features extracted will be used with the detection algorithms.

\section{Multiple Feature Extraction}
The classes hyperparameter will be set to the number of anomalies (plus 1). The features will be used in the isolation algorithms. The only problem with this, is a very evident 2 classes is eclipse and non-ecplise. Consequently each feature extraction model will be trained twice. Once for the eclipse and once for the non-eclipse period.
